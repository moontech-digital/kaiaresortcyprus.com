										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the heart of the beautiful North-Cyprus coast, a new residential project is taking root &#8211; KAIA. KAIA isn&#8217;t just another housing project, but a manifestation of our commitment towards sustainable living and eco-friendly development practices. It is our ode to the future, a harmonious blend of luxury, comfort, and ecological responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the conceptualization and design of KAIA, we have integrated the principles of sustainability in three main categories &#8211; Passive, Active, and Social. We believe that the key to genuine sustainability lies in this intricate balance, allowing us to create an environment that benefits residents, society, and nature alike.</p>



<p>The Passive approach prioritizes natural parameters, efficiency, and flexibility. It takes into account the local climate and natural elements, creating optimal thermal comfort. Shading, wind, air quality, and acoustics have been carefully considered to ensure a comfortable micro-climate within the development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Active approach focuses on leveraging technology for sustainability. Solar hot water collectors are used to meet household hot water demands. Grey water systems help in saving water, while the water management systems increase efficiency. We&#8217;ve made the most of the Mediterranean climate for clean energy generation. These technological interventions ensure that KAIA remains energy-efficient, minimizing our carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Social aspect is equally important. We&#8217;ve crafted KAIA as a community that encourages interaction and enhances well-being. We&#8217;ve designed communal spaces that host events, markets, festivals, and more. The spaces cater to all ages and promote physical activities such as walking and sports, all while ensuring a biophilic design supporting relaxation and tranquillity.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Our residences are more than just homes &#8211; they are an embodiment of our philosophy of sustainability. From the careful orientation of the buildings to minimize solar gain in the summer and maximize it in the winter, to the selection of vegetation to ensure good air quality, every detail has been fine-tuned with sustainability in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIA is about harmonious co-existence. It is where luxury meets sustainability, where community meets individuality, and where nature meets design. It is our commitment towards future generations, and our vision of what the future of residential living should be – a place where we live, grow, thrive, and sustain.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As GMH Development, we are proud to be at the forefront of this exciting journey. With KAIA, we continue our commitment to eco-conscious development and hope to inspire others to join us in this endeavor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KAIA isn&#8217;t just a residential project, it&#8217;s a comprehensive lifestyle destination masterfully designed to harmonize with the needs of our diverse residents. We believe in creating an environment that complements the rhythm of everyday life, fostering a community that values wellness, connection, sustainability, and enjoyment in equal measure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this ethos, the culinary journey plays a significant role. Our on-site restaurant, expertly managed by seasoned chefs, offers an eclectic array of international and local delicacies. Post-meal, residents can unwind at the pool bar, relishing in an enchanting environment that intertwines the serene ambiance with the mesmerizing views of the coast. Understanding the ever-evolving work norms, we offer a thoughtfully designed co-working space within our community. This serves as an innovative hub for professionals, providing them with a flexible, inspiring environment that fuels productivity, collaboration, and creativity.</p>



<p>At KAIA, we believe that shared activities and experiences bring people closer. Our community gardens are a testament to this philosophy, serving as verdant spaces where residents can cultivate their own produce, connect with nature, and foster a sense of shared responsibility towards the environment. Our strategic location also allows for direct access to a pristine sandy beach, offering residents the chance to relish the coastline’s tranquility and beauty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appreciating nature&#8217;s bounty doesn&#8217;t end at the beach. Our scenery viewing platform offers panoramic views of the surroundings, serving as a constant reminder of the stunning locale we call home. The network of walking and cycling paths that crisscross the development encourage residents to explore the outdoors and engage in regular physical activity.</p>



<p>Wellness is woven into the fabric of KAIA’s design. Our fitness studio, equipped with the latest facilities, caters to various fitness routines, while yoga classes promote mental well-being. For a more leisurely approach to wellness, our spa, sauna, and hot tubs offer a sanctuary for relaxation and rejuvenation. The traditional Hammam and steam room further enhance the wellness offering, providing a unique mix of relaxation and luxury.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p>Recognizing the importance of catering to our younger residents, we have dedicated spaces for children. Our vibrant children&#8217;s pool and playground are designed to engage them in fun, physical activities. Adults too have their dedicated pool, perfect for those seeking a peaceful swim.</p>



<p>Rounding off our comprehensive lifestyle offering is our community market. It provides a convenient shopping solution within the community, offering a range of local and sustainable products. In essence, KAIA aims to transform every single day into a unique lifestyle experience that touches upon all facets of modern living.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the evolving landscape of residential living, we, at GMH Development, have proudly embarked on our latest venture, KAIA. As a North-Cyprus based company, we are fusing architectural elegance and sustainable living to redefine community-based living. KAIA, our new coastal haven, merges seamlessly with the serenity of its natural habitat, offering an idyllic and sustainable residential experience. Nestled amidst the picturesque landscape, we’ve crafted eight exclusive villas. With a spacious 145 sqm of net interior, lofty ceilings, a useful mezzanine, and generous outdoor spaces, each villa is a testament to our unwavering commitment to design and quality. Here, luxury coexists with sustainability, offering residents an eco-friendly haven with unrivalled sea views.</p>



<p>Just a stone’s throw from these villas, our Courtyard houses enrich the diversity of the KAIA community. Each 145 sqm unit, complete with a 3+1 loft and a separate 1+1 guest house, encapsulates our understanding of contemporary living. From the versatile mezzanine to the terraces and gardens, we’ve designed these houses to adapt to the varying lifestyles of our residents. In addition to our courtyards, our unique two-bedroom duplex houses offer an intimate retreat. With a 95 sqm interior space, these units are designed to emphasise relaxation and privacy. From a functional mezzanine and office to the possibility of a jacuzzi on the balcony of the third-floor master bedroom, we’re redefining luxury living. And last but not least, our attached one and two-bedroom apartment block offer a more lively and integrated community experience as they are located right by the pool as well as the amenities building.</p>
